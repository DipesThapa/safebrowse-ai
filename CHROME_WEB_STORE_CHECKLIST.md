- Focus Mode (Kid Homework Mode)
  - One-click toggle blocks social, gaming, streaming/video; only educational sites allowed during session.
  - Session timer options: 30/45/60 minutes; countdown visible in popup and badge.
  - Default allowlist: Wikipedia, Khan Academy, .edu/.org domains; user can extend allowlist.
  - Optional PIN to end early; override prompt noted in UI.
  - SafeSearch enforced while active.
- AI captions/object detection (local-only)
  - Lightweight model (ONNX Runtime Web or TFLite WASM) for NSFW/violence/weapon classes; no images leave device.
  - Runs on-demand against thumbnails/screenshots; cached per-URL; throttled to limit battery/CPU.
  - If risky: trigger interstitial, log signal for override review, and optionally show a short caption.
  - Messaging: “On-device AI scan — no data leaves your browser.”
- Assets
  - Icons (128/48/16) — already present under `assets/icons/`
  - Screenshots (1280×800 or 640×400): popup, interstitial, allowlist management, Focus Mode toggle with timer countdown, interstitial showing “on-device AI scan” note
  - Optional promo video (YouTube)
- Privacy & policy
  - Link `PRIVACY.md` (no data collection; storage for settings only)
  - No remote servers; on‑device processing
- Manifest & permissions
  - `storage` and `declarativeNetRequest` only
  - Content scripts restricted to `http/https` matches
- QA scenarios
  - Toggle enabled ON/OFF from popup
  - Add/remove allowlist entries; confirm DNR rules update
  - Visit a blocklisted domain -> interstitial; test override
  - Google/Bing search -> verify SafeSearch params
  - Heuristic keywords -> verify interstitial
  - Start Focus Mode for 30/45/60 min -> verify social/gaming/streaming blocked, edu allowlist works
  - Focus timer survives browser restart/sleep; countdown/badge updates
  - Attempt to end early -> prompt respects PIN setting; override restores normal rules
  - Edit allowlist during Focus Mode -> rules update without ending session
  - Multiple windows/tabs -> same session state; interstitial still appears on blocked domains
  - Focus duration dropdown -> persists selection; 2-minute test works; badge/countdown reflect chosen duration
  - AI scan: mixed content pages (cartoons vs. real images), small thumbnails, low-light images; confirm local inference blocks NSFW/violence/weapons and SafeSearch/DNR still apply
- Release process
  - Tag `vX.Y.Z` -> GitHub Release artifact via workflow
  - Upload the same zip to Chrome Web Store for review

Notes: Follow brand guidelines; avoid misleading claims; keep permissions minimal and documented.
